**ABOUT THIS REPOSITORY: PERSONAL NOTE**

Hello and welcome to my Udemy Python Projects repository!

Thank you for taking the time to look through the projects, I'm very proud to showcase as an ode to my progress of self-learning and structured learning. 

Why did I do this? Simple!! I decided to begin programming in Python because I felt this language was very intuitive to me but also, a great starting point in becoming an apsiring data engineer or data analyst!

I started self-learing in April 2022 and with about two months of experience, I landed an internship at Cedars-Sinai working within the Computation Biomedicine department for 6-8 weeks! While it was exciting, it very much was like swimming in an ocean of advanced topics such as Machine Learning, data engineering, feature importance, and other data science related items. I also need to pick up on how to use (probobably not in an efficient manner) tools such as Pandas, Numpy, Scikit, Matpltlib, and more. My summer project was to research a topic called Shapley Values, understand the benefits/faults of implementing the method in post-ML analysis, and create my own program to work off of my mentor's ML research project.

Fast-forward after the internship, as brtual as it was, I felt I did the best to my abilities to work on my summer project but being who I am, I want to learn in a structured manner before exploring other ways of programming.  It's pretty difficult to navigate learning any programing language without actual guidance and proper information. Not even StackOverflow could save me if my life depended on it considering how many people (at varying levels) are able to resolve various debugging issues. 

I purchased this course because I believe it's essential to truly demonstrate to my future employer: my progress, showcase my knowledge and application of my knowledge, and provide a clear sense of what tools I am familiar with using. This is a great opportunity for me to begin building my portfolio and eventually, come into my own as an individual who could bring value to an organization.  While this course is called "100 days", obviously as a new learner to most of these tools and practices comes with its caveats unless I was some sort of superhuman with photographic memory.

The levels in this course are split into:
 * Beginner      (Day 1 - Day 14)
 * Intermediate  (Day 15 - Day 31) ***
 * Intermediate+ (Day 32 - Day 57)
 * Advanced      (Day 58 - Day 80)
 * Professional  (Day 81 - Day 100)
